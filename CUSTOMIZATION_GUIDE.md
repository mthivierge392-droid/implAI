## 🚀 Quick Customization (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Company Branding

Edit the file: **`config/site.ts`**

```typescript
export const siteConfig = {
  // Company Information
  company: {
    name: "AI Phone Agents Dashboard",        // ← Change to client's company name
    supportEmail: "support@example.com",      // ← Change to client's support email
  },

  // Legal Information
  legal: {
    jurisdiction: "United States",             // ← Change to client's jurisdiction
    lastUpdated: "2024-01-01",                // ← Update to deployment date
  },

  // URLs
  urls: {
    website: "https://example.com",            // ← Change to client's website
    privacy: "/legal/privacy",                 // Keep as is
    terms: "/legal/terms",                     // Keep as is
  },
} as const;
```

**That's it!** This single file controls:
- ✅ Footer copyright text
- ✅ Privacy Policy page content
- ✅ Terms of Service page content

## 🔧 Advanced Customization

### Changing Logo and Favicon

To update your branding visuals:

1. **Replace the favicon** (`public/favicon.ico`):
   - Convert your logo PNG to ICO format:  https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/
   - Recommended size: 32x32 or 48x48 pixels
   - Save as `favicon.ico` in the `public/` folder

2. **Replace the app icon** (`public/apple-touch-icon.png`):
   - Use a PNG file
   - Recommended size: 180x180 pixels or larger
   - This image appears:
     - As the app icon when added to mobile home screen
     - **As the logo in the dashboard top-left corner**

**Important:** Both the favicon and dashboard logo will update when you replace `apple-touch-icon.png`!

### Modifying Legal Content

If your client needs custom legal language:

1. **Privacy Policy**: Edit `app/legal/privacy/page.tsx`
2. **Terms of Service**: Edit `app/legal/terms/page.tsx`

Both files import `siteConfig` and use it for dynamic values, but you can modify the legal text as needed.

### Changing Footer Style

Edit `components/Footer.tsx`:
- Modify layout (single line vs. multi-line)
- Change colors, spacing, or typography
- Add/remove legal links

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Keep it Simple**: The config file is designed for non-technical clients
2. **Version Control**: Always commit config changes before deployment
3. **Test Locally First**: Run `npm run dev` to preview changes
4. **Production Build**: Run `npm run build` to verify before deploying
